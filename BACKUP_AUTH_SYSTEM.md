- ✅ Accountant role support
- ✅ User management working

## 📁 Key Files Backed Up

### 1. Authentication Components
- `components/AuthGuard.tsx` - Main authentication guard
- `components/RoleGuard.tsx` - Role-based access control
- `components/Sidebar.tsx` - Navigation with all items visible

### 2. Pages
- `app/page.tsx` - Welcome page (no auto-redirect)
- `app/accountants/page.tsx` - Accountant dashboard
- `app/users/page.tsx` - User management (admin only)

### 3. API Routes
- `app/api/users/[id]/route.ts` - User CRUD operations
- `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - NextAuth configuration

### 4. Models & Configuration
- `models/UserExtra.ts` - User schema with accountant role
- `lib/authOptions.ts` - NextAuth configuration

- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

## 🔄 Authentication Flow

1. **Unauthenticated user** → Redirected to `/login`
2. **User logs in** → Redirected to `/dashboard`
3. **RoleGuard checks** → Enforces role-based access:
   - Accountant: Only `/accountants`
   - Admin: All pages
   - Staff: Limited access

## 🚀 How to Restore

If you need to restore this working system:

1. **Restore AuthGuard.tsx** - Contains proper authentication checking
2. **Restore RoleGuard.tsx** - Contains role-based routing logic
3. **Restore page.tsx** - Contains welcome page (no auto-redirect)
4. **Keep current middleware.ts** - Already properly configured

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **DO NOT** change the authentication flow without testing
- **DO NOT** modify the role-based routing without backup
- **ALWAYS** test login functionality after changes
- **KEEP** the current working middleware configuration

## 🧪 Test Commands

```bash
# Test authentication flow
npm run dev
# Visit any page → Should redirect to login
# Login → Should redirect to dashboard
# Try restricted pages → Should redirect based on role
```
